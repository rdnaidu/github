    Use Twilio to accept SMS messages and translate them into queries against a 
    SQLite database. These example functions show how to access an Employee 
    Directory via SMS. A mobile phone user can send a text message with a partial 
    string of the person's name and it will return their picture and contact 
    information (Email address and Phone number).

    Use Twilio to provide your user with multiple options through phone calls, 
    so they can be assisted by an agent specialized in the chosen topic. 
    This is basically a call center created with the TaskRouter API of Twilio. 
    This example uses a SQLite database to log phone calls which were not assisted.
